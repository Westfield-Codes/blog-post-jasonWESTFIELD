<h1>What are Dogs Telling <strong><em>Us</em></strong>? 
<h5>By <em><a href="mailto:jason202120@student-schoolsofwestfield.org">Jason Melo</a> 10/15/24</em></h5>
<p>When you come home to your obedient pup they are generally happy but this is not the case while you are away at work. Dogs actually get very bad anxiety and most Likely are thinking, “I wish my owner were home right now so I could play rope with them!” which is why when you get home things around the house will be torn, ripped, or if you have camara’s you can watch them run, jump, and bark all over the house.</p>
<h2>How do Dogs Recognize the Basics of Our Communication?</h2>
<p> A lot of people think that dogs can’t understand us at all but <strong>they really do</strong>! Dogs have an ability to read tone of voice, body language, and eventually after you say a set of words with an action they can even learn what the words you are saying mean. They do this by separating the way we speak into two different sections, the first is the intonation in which we say it, and the second is the meaning of what we say. </p>
<br>
<p>The intonation piece of what we say goes to the right hemisphere of their brain whereas in the left hemisphere of the dog's brain it processes the meaning just like how we humans process each other's speaking.</p>
<h2>How Do Dogs Show Their Emotions To Us?</h2>
<p>Dogs show their emotions with a mix of tail movements, ear movement, and body expressions. Here is a table of the different common emotions they can experience throughout your time with them.</p>
<br>
<table border="1" width="90%">
	<tr>
	<th width="100"><h2>Emotions</h2></th>
	<th><h2>Picture</h2></th>
	<th><h2>Expression</h2></th>
    </tr>
	<tr>
		<td><h4>Happy </h4></td>
		<td> <img src="https://www.young-williams.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/happy-dog-with-sunglasses-floating-ring_11zon-scaled.jpg" width="500px"></td>
		<td><p>Dogs show their happiness by having a more relaxed body posture and a soft facial expression.</p>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
		<h4>Sad </h4>
		</td>
		<td> <img src="https://www.akc.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Cavalier-King-Charles-Spaniel-laying-down-indoors.jpeg" width="500px"></td>
		<td>
		<p>When a dog is sad they will want to be alone, have dull eyes, not want to look at you, his body will be low as well as his tail, and they will lose interest in things they usually enjoy.</p></td></tr>
		<tr>
		<td> <h4>Mad </h4></td>
		<td> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Mad_dog.jpg" width="500px"></td>
<td><p>A dog displaying anger will look large, standing with his head raised above his shoulders. His body will be tense, with weight either centered or over all four feet or leaning slightly forward onto the front legs. He may also have a wrinkled muzzle, a short lip and a hard eye.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><h4>Fear</h4></td>
<td> <img src="https://www.whole-dog-journal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/fear-agg.jpg.optimal.jpg" width="500px"></td>
<td><p>A dog that is experiencing fear may lean away, lean back, tremble, crouch, lower his body or head, or roll onto his side or back. Usually his eyes will be fully open with large pupils, his forehead will be wrinkled, and his tail will be lowered or tucked.</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><h4>Guilt</h4></td>
<td> <img src="https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/2546162/828x1500/flatten;scale;webp=auto;jpeg_quality=60.jpg" width="500px"></td>
<td><p>When dogs feel guilt they usually experience turning their head away, licking their lips, shaking, panting, sometimes they show faces with their nose facing downward, baby-doll eyes, and soft pleading-like noises.</p>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><h4>Aggression</h4></td>
<td> <img src="https://t4.ftcdn.net/jpg/06/61/13/59/360_F_661135911_EvpaZhoaKK5qEFZyXbtl25fWywgfAnax.jpg" width="500px"></td>
<td><p>When dogs are aggressive they have body language that is rigid and tense, with minimal movement. The fur might be raised straight up ,particularly across the shoulders and at the base of the spine near the tail. The dog's weight will be shifted forward in a stiff-legged “ready” stance.</p></tr>

<h2>Can Dogs Understand Us Without Vocal Communication?</h2>
<p>Yes dogs can understand what we are feeling without us even talking because we also show our feelings with body language like stomping when mad or walking upright and lightly which indicates happiness. Dogs actually get much more information from us just purely walking by then we realize which is how they know when we need to have a quiet snuggling dog or a playful excited dog.</p>
