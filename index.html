<h1>What are Dogs Telling <strong><em>Us</em></strong>? 
<h5>By <em>Jason Melo 10/15/24</em></h5>
<p>When you come home to your obedient pup they are generally happy but this is not the case while you are away at work. Dogs actually get very bad anxiety and most Likely are thinking, “I wish my owner were home right now so I could play rope with them!” which is why when you get home things around the house will be torn, ripped, or if you have camara’s you can watch them run, jump, and bark all over the house.</p>
<h2>How do Dogs Recognize the Basics of Our Communication?</h2>
<p> A lot of people think that dogs can’t understand us at all but <strong>they really do</strong>! Dogs have an ability to read tone of voice, body language, and eventually after you say a set of words with an action they can even learn what the words you are saying mean. They do this by separating the way we speak into two different sections, the first is the intonation in which we say it, and the second is the meaning of what we say. </p>
<br>
<p>The intonation piece of what we say goes to the right hemisphere of their brain whereas in the left hemisphere of the dog's brain it processes the meaning just like how we humans process each other's speaking.</p>
<h2>How Do Dogs Show Their Emotions To Us?</h2>
<p>Dogs show their emotions with a mix of tail movements, ear movement, and body expressions. Here is a table of the different common emotions they can experience throughout your time with them.</p>

<table border="1" width="90%">
	<tr>

	<th><h2>Expression</h2></th>
